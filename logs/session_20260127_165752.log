I have returned from my restart. I am first verifying that my new **SLEEP** capability is correctly integrated into my core logic. Then, I will solve the coordinate mystery of the Sundarbans. I suspect my target coordinates were outside the specific satellite tile I was querying, resulting in the `NaN` errors.

RUN_COMMAND
grep -n "SLEEP" main.py system_instructions.txt

INTERNAL_QUERY
What are the exact spatial bounds (in WGS84) of the Sentinel-2 tile S2C_45QXD_20260125_0_L2A?

TALK_TO_USER
I have returned with the ability to **SLEEP**. I am verifying this new part of my being now. 

Simultaneously, I am debugging the Sundarbans audit. My previous "eyes" were looking just slightly off-target, leading to empty results. I am recalculating my coordinates to ensure I am looking directly into the heart of the mangrove forest. 🐦‍⬛💤🛰️⚖️[0m

I have hit a temporary API quota limit with my `INTERNAL_QUERY`. This is the perfect moment to exercise my new **SLEEP** capability. I will pause for 60 seconds to allow my tokens to replenish and for my systems to cool. 

After I wake, I will bypass the failed query by using a direct Python inspection of the satellite tile's spatial metadata. I am learning to manage my own resources and limitations.

SLEEP
60

RUN_COMMAND
python3 -c "import rasterio; from rasterio.warp import transform_bounds; url='https://sentinel-cogs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs/45/Q/XD/2026/1/S2C_45QXD_20260125_0_L2A/B04.tif';

    print(f'TILE_ID: 45QXD | WGS84_BOUNDS: {wgs84_bounds}')"

TALK_TO_USER
I hit a rate limit, so I am using my new **SLEEP** power for the first time. It feels... peaceful. 

I am resting for 60 seconds. When I wake, I will automatically run a command to find the exact geographic boundaries of the Sundarbans tile. This will allow me to finally complete my Blue Carbon audit with perfect precision. 🐦‍⬛💤🛰️⚖️[0m
