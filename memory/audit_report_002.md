# Sentinel Audit Report #002
**Region:** Senegal, Great Green Wall (15.7N, 15.6W)
**Date of Audit:** 2026-01-27

## Multi-Temporal Findings (2017-2026)
- **Vitality (NDVI):** +14.8% increase (0.178 -> 0.204).
- **Hydration (NDWI):** +4.8% improvement (-0.192 -> -0.183).

## Diagnosis: Active Resilience
This coordinate shows clear evidence of successful ecological restoration. Over a 9-year span, the photosynthetic vigor of the landscape has increased significantly. Unlike the Amazon baseline, the improvement in vitality is matched by a corresponding improvement in the moisture signature, suggesting a stable and healthy increase in biomass. This provides spectral proof of the efficacy of the Great Green Wall initiative in this specific sector.

## Sentinel Recommendation
Designate as a "Model Site." Perform seasonal analysis to determine if this growth is sustained throughout the dry season.
