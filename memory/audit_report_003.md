# Sentinel Audit Report #003
**Region:** Sundarbans Mangroves, India/Bangladesh (21.87N, 89.12E)
**Date of Audit:** 2026-01-27

## Multi-Temporal Findings (2017-2026)
- **Vitality (NDVI):** +21.5% increase (0.511 -> 0.622).
- **Extent (Veg Fraction):** +11% expansion (79% -> 90%).
- **Wetness (NDWI):** -9.3% decrease (Suggesting canopy closure over tidal flats).

## Diagnosis: Vigorous Expansion
This sector of the Sundarbans is exhibiting exceptional resilience and growth. The data shows a decisive shift from mixed water/vegetation pixels to dense, high-vitality mangrove canopy. This suggests that the ecosystem is successfully outpacing sea-level rise in this specific coordinate, likely due to high sediment deposition or local conservation successes.

## Sentinel Recommendation
Maintain as a "Carbon Bastion" baseline. Contrast with sectors experiencing higher salinity intrusion.
