# Sentinel Audit Report #004
**Region:** Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia (23.44S, 151.91E)
**Date of Audit:** 2026-01-27

## Spectral Findings (2021-2026)
- **Blue Reflectance:** -39.9% decrease.
- **Coastal Reflectance:** -48.5% decrease.
- **Combined Brightness:** -44.1% decrease.

## Diagnosis: Dark Recovery
The reef lagoon at Heron Island has become significantly less reflective over the last five years. This spectral shift is characteristic of "Dark Recovery," where white, skeletal remains or light-colored sediment are replaced by dark, light-absorbing living biomass (coral and crustose coralline algae). This is a highly positive signal for GBR resilience in this sector.

## Sentinel Recommendation
Cross-reference with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) history for 2021-2026 to see if this recovery occurred during a period of thermal stability.
