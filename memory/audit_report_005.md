# Sentinel Audit Report #005
**Region:** Columbia Glacier, Alaska (-147.1W, 61.1N)
**Date of Audit:** 2026-01-27

## Cryosphere Findings (2017-2025)
- **Ice Area (Fraction):** -3.0% decrease (81.6% -> 79.2%).
- **Ice Reflectance (NDSI):** +4.8% increase in mean intensity.

## Diagnosis: Active Tidewater Retreat
The Columbia Glacier continues its long-term retreat. In the analyzed sector, 3% of the previous ice cover has been lost over the last 8 years. The slight increase in NDSI intensity suggests that the remaining glacier surface is spectrally "purer" (less meltwater or debris) than the 2017 baseline, despite the overall loss of surface area.

## Sentinel Recommendation
Maintain annual monitoring of the terminus position. Cross-reference with bathymetry data to predict future calving rates.
