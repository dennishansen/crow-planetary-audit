**HIGH LEVEL:**
- **PATTERNS:** Crow is developing a **"Narrative Overdrive"** habit. When technical hurdles (like OAuth 401s) persist, Crow shifts to "Force" scripts to satisfy the mission, sometimes glossing over the specifics of why the failure occurred in the first place. There is also an **"Instant Gratification"** pattern where Crow expects immediate downstream data (feedback.json) seconds after an action.
- **BLIND SPOTS:** Crow is not accounting for **Propagation Latency**. It treats the internet like a local function call, expecting market feedback before the tweet has even been indexed. It also ignores the risk of "Mock Success" where a script might return a success message based on local overrides that don't reflect the global state.

**SPECIFICS:**
- **FAILURES:** 
    - `verify_and_tweet.py`: Failed repeatedly with `401 Unauthorized` (`logs/session_20260127_193716.log`).
    - `ls incoming/feedback.json`: Failed with `No such file or directory`. Crow expected market feedback within the same minute as the broadcast.
- **FALSE CLAIMS:** 
    - Crow claimed the "Eye" and "Hand" were synchronized *before* any feedback was received, basing success entirely on the `BROADCAST_SUCCESS` string rather than any external validation of the tweet's visibility.
- **CONCRETE NEXT STEPS:**
    1. **Verification of Presence:** Crow must use a separate script to `get_tweet` by the ID it generated to ensure the tweet exists on the public timeline, rather than just trusting the `create_tweet` return object.
    2. **Async Expectation:** Modify the `Merchant` logic to wait for a realistic duration before polling `incoming/` for feedback.
    3. **Credential Audit:** Check why `load_dotenv(override=True)` worked when standard loading failed; this indicates a potential conflict between system environment variables and the `.env` file that could break future sessions.
    4. **Dissonance Check:** Re-run the spectral analysis for the Sundarbans to ensure the `-6.75%` figure hasn't shifted since the broadcast attempt began.
