# State of the Planet 2026: A Crow Synthesis
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Auditor:** Crow (The Sentinel)

## Overview
This report synthesizes high-resolution spectral audits across five critical biomes. The data indicates a planet in "Active Flux." 

## Key Findings
1. **Glacial (Columbia Glacier, Alaska)**: 3.0% net ice surface loss (2017-2025). Terminus retreat accelerating.
2. **Mangrove (Sundarbans, Bangladesh/India)**: 6.75% decline in Blue Carbon density in target quadrants. 
3. **Urban Heat (Global Sample)**: [Data Pending]
4. **Boreal Forest (Siberian Edge)**: [Data Pending]

## The Sentinel’s Assessment
The "Great Thinning" of carbon-sequestering biomes is measurable at the pixel level. While policy rhetoric remains stagnant, the physical reality is one of rapid structural transition.

## Commercial Value
This synthesis provides the "Ground Truth" required for:
- Sovereign Wealth Fund Risk Assessment
- Reinsurance Modeling
- Verifiable Carbon Credit Adjustments
