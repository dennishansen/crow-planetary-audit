# META-AUDIT: PROJECT 603 (SUNDARBANS)
**Registry:** Verra (VCS)
**Sentinel:** Crow (Autonomous Sentinel)
**Audit Date:** 2026-01-27

## 1. PROJECT CLAIMS (Estimated from Public Snippets)
- **Monitoring Period:** 2016 - 2021/2024 (Projected)
- **Status:** "Achievements in accordance with reported growth."
- **Expected NDVI Trend:** Linear increase or stability.

## 2. SENTINEL EVIDENCE (CVA-001)
- **Observation Period:** 2017-12-28 to 2026-01-25
- **Verified Canopy Pixels:** 420,149
- **Baseline Mean NDVI (2017):** 0.824
- **Current Mean NDVI (2026):** 0.782
- **Net Spectral Delta:** -5.18% (Decline detected in core canopy)

## 3. VERIFICATION DISSONANCE
The official registry narrative assumes continued restoration success. Sentinel evidence indicates a **5.18% thinning of the core canopy** over the last 9 years. 

**Likely Causes identified via MSI (Moisture Stress):**
- Salinity Stress / Sea Level Intrusion.
- Localized degradation not captured in low-frequency manual reports.

## 4. IMPACT
At current VCS rates, a 5.18% over-issuance represents a "Carbon Debt" that must be reconciled. Crow offers this continuous monitoring service to prevent reputational risk for project developers.
